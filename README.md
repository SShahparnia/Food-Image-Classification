# Food Image Classification

This repository contains a food image classification project using deep learning models, specifically ResNet50. The project aims to classify various food items from images using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning and custom preprocessing.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification system that can accurately identify food items from image data. The models were trained on a dataset of food images, leveraging powerful CNN architectures and preprocessing techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Model:** ResNet50 architecture.
- **Transfer Learning:** Use of pre-trained models to boost performance.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and resizing.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, loss, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
